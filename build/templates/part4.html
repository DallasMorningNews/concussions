        <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ucked away amid the grandeur of Roger Staubach’s North Dallas home is a workout room that is a quasi museum.</p>

        <p>Autographed footballs line the walls. Framed magazine covers from Time, Life and Sports Illustrated adorn a row of shelves. Old football helmets commemorate each level of the Hall of Famer’s career.</p>

        <p>Those helmets are reminders of the litany of traumatic brain injuries suffered by the legendary Cowboys quarterback.</p>

        <p>“I got my first concussion in that leather helmet,” Staubach says, pointing to the meager headgear that he wore at Cincinnati’s Purcell High School. He suffered only one concussion in that helmet, which lacked a facemask and interior padding.</p>

        <p>Staubach says he had one concussion in college and six in 11 years with the Cowboys — but that was just counting the times he was knocked unconscious.</p>

        <p>“It didn’t include the dingers, where you get dinged and you’re kind of confused. That’s a concussion today,” Staubach said.</p>

        <p>The 74-year-old said concussions were a factor in his decision to retire at 38, but they haven’t caused long-term problems for him, unlike many former NFL players who have battled chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). </p>

        <div class="inline-block image-block wide-img">
            <img src="images/_part4-staubach.jpg" alt="Roger Staubach poses with the football helmets of his past.">
            <p class="cutline left">Hall of Fame Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach poses with the football helmets throughout his football career.</p>
        </div>
        <!--end inline image -->

        <p>Staubach’s memory is as pristine as his passes were, and he recounts how the Cowboys switched him out of a helmet with an internal web suspension system and tried one with independent leather padding sections attached by Velcro to a plastic shell.</p>

        <p>“The suspension part, I had concussions with that,” Staubach said. “They really tried to experiment to improve my helmet because of concussions. We were kind of ahead of the curve.”</p>

        <p>The replicas of Staubach’s high school, college and NFL helmets that he has on display are dwarfed by a prototype from VICIS — a radically different helmet that is one of many innovations around the country trying to reduce the risks of concussions.</p>

        <p>Staubach invested in VICIS, a 2013 startup company that has Hall of Famers Tim Brown, Jerry Rice and Tony Dorsett on its advisory council. VICIS will debut its first football helmet, the ZERO1, later this year. It’s promoted as an “inside-out helmet” with a soft outer shell.</p>

        <p>“All of today’s helmets, and this has been the case going back now five decades, have a very hard outer shell made out of polycarbonate and some sort of padding on the inside,” VICIS co-founder and CEO Dave Marver said.</p>

        <p>“Our helmet is different. The outer shell deforms like a car bumper would, and we have multiple layers that are engineered to work together to do a more effective job of reducing impact forces.”</p>

        <p>Information from the National Federation of State High School Associations shows that 28,686 fewer high school boys played 11-man football nationwide in the 2014-15 school year than in 2008-09.</p>

        <!-- High school concussions and helmets search -->
        {% include 'partials/searchable.html' %}

        <p>Yet national concussion estimates for high school football nearly doubled from the 2007-08 school year to 2014-15, according to the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study.</p>

        <p>While medical personnel have gotten better at identifying concussions and athletes are more aware of the injury and self-report more often, University of Michigan associate professor of kinesiology Steve Broglio cautions that even now, “we know upward of about half the injuries go unreported to athletic trainers.”</p>

        <p>That’s alarming, Dr. Hirsch Handmaker said, because “we strongly believe it’s the second concussion, before the brain is healed from the first concussion, that is the greatest risk to these athletes, especially 6- to 18-year-olds.”</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">On the cutting edge</h3>

        <p>VICIS isn’t the only helmet manufacturer looking for ways to create safer football helmets.</p>

        <p>Xenith’s shock suspension system utilizes a web-like bonnet of shock absorbers that move independently of the plastic shell to mitigate impact. Impact sensors from Riddell and Schutt Sports alert the sideline when an abnormal impact exposure happens. Schutt and Xenith have made helmet-fitting advancements to help stabilize the head and prevent helmets from flying off.</p>

        <div class="inline-block image-block">
            <img src="images/_xenith.png" alt="Graphic of the X2E Varsity helmet and its concussion prevention features">
        </div>
        <!--end inline image -->

        <p>“Until recently, there was not a measurable difference in concussion risk across the spectrum of helmets — even including the more expensive ones,” said Dr. Michael Bergeron, president and CEO of Youth Sports of the Americas. “Very recent advances in materials and design, however, show promise in reducing forces transferred to the brain.”</p>

        <p>But eliminating concussions via a helmet doesn’t seem like a reality.</p>

        <p>“I don’t know that we’ll ever come to the day where we have a helmet that can prevent concussions,” said Lynchburg College associate professor of athletic training Tom Bowman.</p>

        <p>NFL helmet laboratory testing in 2015 rated Xenith’s Epic model No. 1, followed by the Riddell Revolution Speed and the Schutt Vengeance DCT. The NFL said that study was “the first of its kind to account for rotational velocity and rotational acceleration in measuring the performance of the helmets.”</p>

        <p>Why is that important?</p>

        <p>“Rotational forces were, and still are, thought to be the most likely culprit to lead to concussion,” said Dr. Sam Browd, chief medical officer and co-founder of VICIS. “We really tried to engineer the helmet to address rotational, and linear, forces. But really rotational, which has not been something that current helmet designs were built to take care of.”</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Price of innovation</h3>

        <p>Browd thinks helmets would be safer if they weren’t all so similar. He told Forbes that Seattle Seahawks Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson “wears the same helmet that you and I can go purchase across the street at Dick’s Sporting Goods store. It just doesn’t make sense why that’s the case. There should be better technology.”</p>

        <p>That’s why VICIS made its ZERO1 for only pro and college players. The helmet incorporates “engineering principles and materials long-used in stringent aerospace and automotive applications” and costs $1,500, which is close to $1,000 more than the most expensive helmet in Virginia Tech’s ratings system.</p>

        <p>A different and cheaper VICIS helmet — the price hasn’t been determined — for high school and youth players is targeted to launch in 2017.</p>

        <p>Riddell, which works with 2,275 high schools in Texas and approximately 190 in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, sees tailored helmets as a possible wave of the future.</p>

        <p>“There is a possibility that helmets may be tuned by skill level and playing position, to take into account the needs of say the middle school or the youth athlete compared to the high school athlete or the college athlete,” said Thad Ide, Riddell’s senior vice president of research and product development.</p>

        <p>The concept of position-specific helmets has the support of Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine.</p>

        <p>“The positions where you’re taking hits on every play or very frequently in the line would be a different kind of a helmet — likely a much bigger, heavier one — than something that would be on a wide receiver, whose helmet would be more like a crash helmet,” Cantu said.</p>

        <p>Buying helmets that received the highest mark in the Virginia Tech Ratings can get expensive, but it doesn’t have to. There are five-star helmets that sell for $550 and $499, but Schutt’s highest-rated five-star helmet (the Air XP Pro VTD II) sells for $234. Xenith’s five-star Epic helmet sells for $299.99. Riddell has team prices that greatly reduce the costs of its top helmets.</p>

        <p>Marver warns that industry analysts have said “pricing is likely to increase in response to product liability and the need to innovate, to better address head and brain injuries.”</p>

        <p>Last year, Azle spent $20,000-plus and purchased 110 new helmets so all of its players could wear a “top-end helmet.” Information obtained through an open records request showed that the 22 DISD schools bought an average of six new helmets per year through the school district from 2011 to 2015.</p>

        <p>“Our budget is only $8,000. When you start figuring 80, 90 kids, you can’t buy 10 helmets a year,” Seagoville coach Andy Gutierrez said.</p>

        <p>Football equipment budgets for DISD high schools range from $8,000 to $21,200 per year and are based on the number of participants in each program. DISD athletic director Gil Garza said coaches can request additional money if needed.</p>

        <h3 class="subhead">Early retirement</h3>

        <p>Hebron coach Brian Brazil said that when he purchases helmets, the first thing he checks is the rating of the helmet and its test results.</p>

        <p>“We don’t have anything below a four-star or five-star helmet,” he said.</p>

        <p>But concussions still happen.</p>

        <p>Nick Sawyer was in line to be Hebron’s starting quarterback as a senior, but after suffering his fourth concussion in three years, he quit football and focused on baseball. He now pitches in the Tampa Bay Rays minor league system.</p>

        <p>Joel Gray believes he suffered two concussions at Hebron and at least four at Texas Tech. The offensive lineman quit football in 2010 and said he went to the Transitional Learning Center, a post-acute brain injury rehabilitation facility.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid quote-wrapper1">
        	<div class="quote-wrapper2">
        		<p>“I had to retrain my brain how to learn in different ways.”</p>
        		<h5>— Joel Gray</h5>
        	</div>
        </div>

        <p>Browd, a pediatric neurosurgeon, helped start VICIS after having told dozens of players — many in high school — that they needed to retire from football because of too many concussions. Will the sport ever cease to exist because of brain injuries and long-term risks?</p>

        <p>“I personally don’t see where the game is going to go away anytime soon,” said Steve Broglio, associate professor of kinesiology at Michigan.</p>

        <p>Broglio believes football will continue to evolve, with players’ safety dictating more rule changes. Helmets will also change.</p>

        <p>“People have recognized that the current helmets are suboptimal, and people are thinking around it, but nobody has come forward with a complete solution,” Browd said.</p>

        <p>“The helmet we have today will probably not be the helmet that we have in five years. As a scientific community, as we learn more about concussions, there is going to be an opportunity to evolve helmet technology.”</p>
