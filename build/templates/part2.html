        <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ach year, schools across Texas take their bruised and battered helmets, stuff them into bags, and send them off to factories to undergo “reconditioning.”</p>

        <p>Big helmet manufacturers like Riddell, Schutt and Xenith as well as local factories welcome roughly 1.8 million used helmets a year.</p>

        <p>The goal is to return the helmet back to the manufacturers’ recommended standard by discarding cracked shells and replacing broken or missing pads. The entire process runs between $40 and $60 a unit.</p>

        <p>“The things that we see in helmets or not in helmets are just atrocious,” said Ed Fisher, president for the National Athletic Equipment Reconditioners Association (NAERA). “There are parts missing, there are parts that belong in let’s say a Riddell helmet, they’re in a Schutt and vice versa. … There are parts that do not work.”</p>

        <p>In a Colorado School of Public Health study, helmets reconditioned within a year performed similarly to new helmets, while players concussed in helmets that hadn’t been reconditioned recently suffered longer concussion symptoms.</p>

        <div id="school-database">
            <!-- High school concussions and helmets search -->
            {% include 'partials/searchable.html' %}
        </div>

        <p>The only helmet quality regulation in Texas was passed by the Texas Legislature in 2011. It requires helmets older than 10 years be reconditioned every two years and restricts helmet age to 16 years.</p>

        <p>The law is well out of date. NAERA refuses to recondition helmets 10 years or older, and common policy among Dallas-Fort Worth area schools is to have all their helmets reconditioned within at least a three-year span.</p>

        <p>UIL deputy director Jamey Harrison said the organization’s rule-making body is open to a stricter rule requiring a time frame on reconditioning, but there is no current call for change.</p>

        <p>California is the only state in the nation that has a reconditioning law for every helmet. It requires each to be reconditioned or recertified every year.</p>

        <p>In a SportsDayHS survey of 37 area coaches, 35 said they would be in favor of a rule requiring the reconditioning of all helmets at the high school level at a regular interval, although more than half (19 of 37) were against reconditioning because of budgetary reasons and questions about whether it was necessary that often.</p>

        <p>Dr. Hunt Batjer — chair of the department of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and the chair of the NFL’s head, neck, and spine committee — said the data isn’t there for a state mandate.</p>

        <p>“I hate creating a state mandate that is going to cost a ton of money based on no data or unclear data,” Batjer said.</p>
