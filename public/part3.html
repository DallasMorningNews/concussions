        <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span> study by <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> found that high school football concussions in Texas are much more prevalent than statewide numbers provided by the University Interscholastic League suggest.</p>

        <p>Information obtained through open records requests showed that 234 schools statewide reported 348 football concussions to the UIL in 2015 — an average of 1.5 concussions per school. By contrast, 133 Dallas-area schools had football players suffer 1,079 concussions during the 2015-16 school year — an average of 8.1 concussions per school.</p>

        <p>During the 11-week football regular season, the UIL requires only schools that are a district chair to report injuries — and just for their school, not for every school in their district. In the playoffs, every team in the state is mandated to report injuries on a weekly basis.</p>

        <p>One school in each UIL district is designated as the district chair. That school handles different responsibilities for the district during the school year. For instance, it would be in charge of district meetings to determine the eligibility of an athlete who transferred to a school in the district.</p>

        <p>“I’ve been at the UIL 5&frac12; years, so just about the entire time I’ve been here, we’ve been engaged in conversations about whether or not that injury reporting system fits today’s needs. It’s not difficult to come to the conclusion that it does not,” UIL deputy director Jamey Harrison said. “We’re having this discussion in 2016 about a decision that was made decades ago. It started as some research, as I understand it. It was intended to be a sampling.”</p>

        <p>Last football season, only 16 percent of the UIL’s 1,420 member schools reported concussions and other injuries to Texas’ governing body for high school sports. The 133 Dallas-area schools accounted for just 9 percent of statewide UIL members, but local schools reported more than five times as many concussions on average.</p>

        <p>“There may not be any one reason for the disparity in numbers reported via this system and what was reported to <em>The Dallas Morning News</em>, but it does show one reason why a new concussion reporting system was needed,” UIL public affairs representative Chris Schmidt said in an email.</p>

        <p>“In a few weeks, the UIL, in partnership with UT Southwestern, hopes to roll out a new concussion registry that will track concussions occurring across all sports, in all UIL high schools and middle schools. The UIL’s previous injury reporting system was never meant to be a scientific study, but that is exactly what the new concussion reporting system will be.”</p>

        <p>The pilot program between the UIL and UT Southwestern Medical Center’s Texas Institute for Brain Injury and Repair in Dallas will be voluntary for public and charter schools in Texas this school year. UT Southwestern will analyze the data and provide feedback to the UIL. Harrison said the program could become mandatory as early as next school year.</p>

        <p>Dr. Hunt Batjer, chair of the department of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center, said he hopes that registry will help standardize care across the state and provide some context on an injury that can be unique to the individual, such as how many previous concussions an athlete had, recovery time for each, and what can indicate when a player must sit out the rest of a season or stop playing the sport.</p>

        <p>“No state has done this on this level,” said Spanky Stephens, executive director of the Texas State Athletic Trainers Association. “It is our hope that we’ll get other states to join in with us. Maybe through the contacts that Dr. Batjer has, to hopefully do a nationwide survey.”</p>

        <p>The Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools has required all of its schools to report each concussion and the athlete’s return to play date for the last four years. What does TAPPS do with its information?</p>

        <p>“We warehouse it,” TAPPS executive director Bryan Bunselmeyer said.</p>

        <p>Dawn Comstock, an epidemiology researcher at the Colorado School of Public Health and the creator of the national High School RIO injury surveillance system, said that with no context on the rate of concussions among all participants, it is difficult to compare across districts, teams, sports, gender, etc.</p>

        <p>Comstock said the best practice would be to measure concussions vs. “exposures,” or how much activity a player participated in during the season. One practice or one game for one player counts as one exposure, so 10 players practicing four times and playing in one game a week is 50 exposures for the week.</p>

        <p>For the last 30-plus years, Fairfax County in Virginia has had a comprehensive medical records system in its public school system. Athletic trainers log injuries in the system as part of their notes.</p>

        <p>Connecticut adopted a program last year that required all schools to log their injuries in Comstock’s internet-based High School RIO system. That system is based off of the NCAA’s injury surveillance system.</p>
