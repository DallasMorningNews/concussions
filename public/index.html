    <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>uch of Eno Benjamin&rsquo;s time in football is a blur of touchdown runs and victory celebrations. But the Wylie East senior running back, a top national recruit who is orally committed to Iowa, has a clear memory of his first helmet.</p>

    <p>Benjamin was 7 years old, and the Schutt DNA helmet, white with a black Raiders logo, felt strange as he pulled it over his head. But it was oh so cool. He was officially a football player.</p>

    <p>Southlake Carroll offensive lineman Carson Green, a senior who has pledged to Texas A&amp;M, can go even further back with his memory. He was only 3 years old when he got a plastic Cowboys helmet.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I think it was a Christmas gift,&rdquo; Green said. &ldquo;I remember running around with that on.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that a football player&rsquo;s first helmet, and perhaps all of the helmets, get burned into memory. The helmet is the glamorous finishing piece of the uniform. It&rsquo;s the ultimate symbol of football.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the helmet does not offer the ultimate in protection.</p>

    <p>A 2013 study by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found little evidence that helmets reduce the risk of concussions. At the high school level &#8230; (UIL stats here).</p>

    <p>The increased awareness of the damaging effects of multiple concussions, due in no small part to the NFL&rsquo;s $1 billion settlement with former players, has also led to more scrutiny of how a helmet can and cannot protect a player.</p>

    <p>Dr. Hunt Batjer, chair of the department of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, believes helmets need to change.</p>


<div class="container-fluid quote-wrapper1">
	<div class="quote-wrapper2">
		<p><span class="quotes">&ldquo;</span>That status quo is not acceptable. We know that the current device is inadequate to protect players.<span class="quotes">&rdquo;</span></p>

		<h5>— Dr. Hunt Batjer</h5>
	</div>
</div>


    <p>&ldquo;That status quo is not acceptable,&rdquo; said Batjer, who is also co-chair of the NFL&rsquo;s Head, Neck and Spine Committee. &ldquo;We know that the current device is inadequate to protect players.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The device &ndash; the helmet &ndash; has changed dramatically over the last century, advancing from a simple leather cap with earflaps to the modern polycarbonate shells with full facemasks, energy absorbing padding, and in some cases, sensors to measure impact. But even state-of-the-art materials and engineering have yet to produce a helmet proven to significantly reduce concussions.</p>

    <p>Riddell and Schutt, the country&rsquo;s largest providers of football helmets, mention on their websites that no helmet can prevent all serious head and neck injuries.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Helmets were designed to do two things: protect the skull and absorb direct linear-force impact,&rdquo; said Glenn Beckmann, the director of marketing communications for Schutt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fairytale, a falsehood, that there is a concussion-proof helmet.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Riddell once marketed its Revolution helmet, first introduced in 2002, as specifically designed to reduce concussions. But Riddell stopped boasting a 31 percent reduction in the risk of concussion after the Federal Trade Commission investigated the data to support the claim.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The symptoms that are associated with concussions can come from a lot of different things, and not even necessarily an impact to the athlete&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; said Thad Ide, Riddell&rsquo;s senior vice president over research and product development. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly a confounding issue. But where we can help I think as a headgear manufacturer and designer is just finding ways to reduce the impact exposure that players see on the field.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Helmet manufacturers have succeeded in that regard, at least based on the findings of Virginia Tech University&rsquo;s STAR Rating, which tests helmets for impact protection. In the first year of testing in 2011, only one helmet achieved the highest five-star rating. Last year there were 16 models -- from manufacturers Schutt, Riddell, Xenith, Rawlings and SG -- that achieved the top rating.</p>

    <p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the helmets are preventing more concussions.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They perform better in the laboratory in terms of various tolerance to types of blows, but we don&rsquo;t know if that has clinical relevance,&rdquo; Batjer said. &ldquo;In fact, I am concerned that our current helmets may in fact magnify the severity of more minor injuries.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The reason is that the current adult helmets, which are worn by most high school players, are &ldquo;large standoff&rdquo; helmets. The large standoff helmet, first introduced with the Riddell Revolution in 2002, has a larger shell than previous helmets. That allows for thicker padding between the shell of the helmet and the skull, and the result is more energy absorption on straight-line impacts (linear acceleration).</p>

    <p>But the larger helmets might lead to more frequent helmet contact, and Batjer and other neurologists believe that rotational acceleration can be the most destructive force of a concussion. Rotational acceleration injuries can occur when the brain is twisted within the skull.</p>

    <p>Rotational acceleration is not a factor in the current STAR Ratings, but is expected to be used in ratings later this year.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We believe those rotational forces are the most important,&rdquo; Batjer said. &ldquo;Unfortunately, those are the hardest to measure.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s easier to measure what multiple concussions can do to a player&rsquo;s football career. In recent years, several former Dallas-area high school stars quit their college teams because of concussions, including Texas running back Tre&rsquo; Newton (Southlake Carroll), Oklahoma defensive lineman Daniel Noble (Flower Mound Marcus), Arizona linebacker Rob Hankins (Parish Episcopal) and Texas Tech offensive lineman Joel Gray (Hebron).</p>

    <p>Former SMU defensive back Derrius Bell is another. Bell played at Wilmer-Hutchins as a sophomore, and after the school closed following the 2004 season, he blossomed into a star at Arlington Grace Prep. As a senior at Hillcrest, he was one of the area&rsquo;s top recruits.</p>

    <p>Bell&rsquo;s last game was on Oct. 3, 2009, when he was an SMU junior and made a crushing helmet-to-helmet hit on TCU receiver Ryan Christian.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I ended up knocking him out,&rdquo; Bell said, &ldquo;but I knocked myself out, too.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was Bell&rsquo;s second concussion in a span of three weeks, and after he sat out the rest of the season, doctors advised him to stop playing football. Bell was devastated, but he finished his SMU degree and became a graduate assistant for the Mustangs. Now an assistant coach at UT-El Paso, Bell&rsquo;s instructions to players are different than what he remembers as a kid.</p>

    <p>Bell said nobody told him to lead with his helmet on a tackle, but the big hits were celebrated. There was little mention of protecting himself or the opponent.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt it&rsquo;s changed,&rdquo; Bell said. &ldquo;These days, it&rsquo;s much more at the top of the conversation. Hit with your head up, protect yourself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>USA Football, the national governing body for the sport, launched Heads up Football in 2012 in an effort to improve player safety. One of its primary initiatives is educating players about tackling and blocking techniques that reduce helmet contact.</p>

    <p>Reducing the head contact might be more important than any possible helmet innovation. Rockwall players wear the five-star rated Schutt Vengeance helmets, but coach Rodney Webb said the helmet doesn&rsquo;t matter as much what the player does with it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The helmets that I wore in high school and college, even the helmets of just 10 years ago, wouldn&rsquo;t be deemed safe today, and yet we made it through without any head injury,&rdquo; said Webb, who was an offensive lineman at Tarleton State from 1986 to 1989. &ldquo;At the end of the day, I think it has more to do with the way kids are using their heads and the fit of the helmet.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Whether through improvement in protective gear, changes in tackling and blocking techniques or modifications to the game, player safety will be critical to the future of the sport. Football has seen a decline in youth participants ages 6-17 in recent years, and concerns about safety is often cited as a reason.</p>

    <p>[Note: there is so much data out there on the decrease in youth football participation, with small drops, big drops and in between, depending on age parameters. I didn&rsquo;t think there was one that best reflected this, and wasn&rsquo;t sure we even needed to cite numbers because it has been so well-documented.] </p>

    <p>But a football helmet presents a unique engineering challenge, Beckmann said, especially in a sport in which the players keep getting bigger, faster and stronger. While helmets for sports such as auto racing, baseball and bicycling are designed to destroy themselves to prevent a catastrophic injury, a football helmet can&rsquo;t be one-and-done.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Football helmets have to absorb thousands of impacts and not sacrifice their structural integrity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know most people are looking for simple answers, but it&rsquo;s a very complex biological problem, this problem of concussions, and there are just no simple answers.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But it&rsquo;s important to keep looking, Batjer said, and he sees hope in the Head Health Challenge, which each year gives out financial awards for the discovery, design and development of materials that better dissipate impact. The Challenge, sponsored by the NFL, Under Armour and the U.S. Department of Commerce&rsquo;s National Institute of Standards and Technology, handed out five $250,000 awards last year.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is not simple, but it&rsquo;s solvable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a child and player safety problem that we need to deal with. We need to throw the best science at it, get the best protective devices that are humanly possible, and put them on our players, period. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it costs.&rdquo; </p>
